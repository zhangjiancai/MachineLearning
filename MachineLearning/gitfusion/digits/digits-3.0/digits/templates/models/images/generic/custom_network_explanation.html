<h1>Specifying a custom Caffe network</h1>

<p>
    You should enter a train_val network here. Some cleanup is done for you automatically:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Data layers for the LMDBs in your dataset are created for you automatically</li>
    <li>If you provide a Data layer here and leave the <code>data_param.source</code> blank, it will be filled in for you with the appropriate path</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The deploy network will be created for you automatically. Once caffe implements their "all-in-one" nets feature, you will be able to specify which layers to include in the deploy file. Until then, these things are done automatically:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>All loss layers and accuracy layers are removed from the deploy file</li>
    <li>Layers with names starting with <code>train_</code> are <strong>not included</strong> in the deploy file</li>
    <li>Layers with names starting with <code>deploy_</code> are <strong>only included</strong> in the deploy file</li>
</ul>

<h1>Specifying a custom Torch network</h1>

<p>
    You should enter a Torch network description. Refer to the documentation for more information.
