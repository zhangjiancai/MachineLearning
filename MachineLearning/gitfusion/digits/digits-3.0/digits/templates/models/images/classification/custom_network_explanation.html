<h1>Specifying a custom Caffe network</h1>
<p>
    You should enter a train_val network here. Some cleanup is done for you automatically:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <i>num_output</i> for each <b>InnerProduct</b> layer which is a network output gets set to the number of labels in the chosen dataset.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any <b>Accuracy</b> layers with <i>top_k</i> &gt;= num_labels is removed automatically.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
The deploy network will be created for you automatically. Once caffe implements their "all-in-one" nets feature, you will be able to specify which layers to include in the deploy file. Until then, these things are done automatically:
<ul>
    <li>
        The last <b>SoftmaxWithLoss</b> layer is replaced with a <b>Softmax</b> layer.
    </li>
    <li>
        All other loss layers and accuracy layers are removed.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Specifying a custom Torch network</h1>
<p>
    You should enter a Torch network description here. Refer to the documentation for more information.
